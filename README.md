Read the following excerpt from [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/):

'...The flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” – copying a repository from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.

These three features – fork, pull request and merge – are what make GitHub so powerful. Gregg Pollack of Code School (which just launched a class called TryGit) explains that before GitHub, if you wanted to contribute to an open source project you had to manually download the project’s source code, make your changes locally, create a list of changes called a “patch” and then e-mail the patch to the project’s maintainer. The maintainer would then have to evaluate this patch, possibly sent by a total stranger, and decide whether to merge the changes.

This is where the network effect starts to play a role in GitHub, Pollack explains. When you submit a pull request, the project’s maintainer can see your profile, which includes all of your contributions on GitHub. If your patch is accepted, you get credit on the original site, and it shows up in your profile. It’s like a resume that helps the maintainer determine your reputation. The more people and projects on GitHub, the better idea picture a project maintainer can get of potential contributors. Patches can also be publicly discussed.

Even for maintainers who don’t end up using the GitHub interface, GitHub can make contribution management easier. “I end up just downloading the patch anyway, or merging from the command line instead of from the merge button,” says Isaac Schlueter, the maintainer of the open source development platform Node.js. “But GitHub provides a centralized place where people can discuss the patch.”

Lowering the barrier to entry democratizes open source development, and helps young projects grow. “Node.js wouldn’t be what it is today without GitHub,” Schlueter says. ...'

## Questions

1. What 3 features make Github so powerful? Answer: Forking, Cloning and Merging.
2. How is Github like a resume? Answer: Developers can submit work to a project via pull request. This creates a history that is visable to the community. As a developer grows the "resume" of accepted pull request they will gain trust and credibility within the softwared development community within GitHub. The developer can then offer their GitHub as part of their resume when applying for work. 

3. Send a direct message to your coach with the answer to this question: How does Github help young projects grow? Answer submit as direct messag to Kyle: Githhub allows young developers the access to fork and clone projects that they can work on. Once they have something to contribute they can send pull request to the project manager who can evaluate their work and chose to merge it into the master repository. The young developer can build their reputation based on their contributions to the community. They also can make connections within the industry through their contributions. 
4. Log into your Github Account, in the 'Overview' tab - update your three pinned repositories (pick any three) A: Task Completed
5. Check your Github contribution map, how many contributions do you have this year? A: 147 contributions this year. 
6. Made a new repo, clone it to your local computer and add a README
7. In the readme, add your name, birthday, and a list of all your favorite things including book, movie, band/music, food and past-time
8. On Github, find 3 repositories you're interested in and 'star' them.  Done 
9. This Github article is interesting, but you don't need to read it for this exercise. Just do number 4 and move on to the next drill
